Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `me.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->


I'm Burhan, a passionate graduate student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-people/burhanuddin-shirose/) specializing in Robotics. My strong foundation in planning and controls, combined with expertise in programming languages and software tools like Python, C/C++, ROS, Solidworks, and more, equips me to tackle complex engineering challenges.

My research at Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Institute focuses on innovative projects, such as [decentralized multi-agent systems](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/project/mmpug-multi-model-perception-uber-good/) for search and rescue missions and optimizing control systems for various applications. I've also made contributions to academia via publications, reflecting my dedication to advancing the field.

I'm excited about the future of robotics and eager to collaborate on cutting-edge projects. Let's connect and explore opportunities to make a difference in the world of engineering and technology together.
