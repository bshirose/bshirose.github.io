In the realm of maritime biosecurity, I undertook a comprehensive endeavor aimed at revolutionizing biofouling detection on ship hulls and docks. A crucial aspect of this initiative involved the creation of a bespoke dataset meticulously tailored to the nuances of biofouling instances encountered in real-world maritime environments. This dataset, thoughtfully curated to encapsulate the diversity of potential biofouling scenarios, served as the foundation for training robust detection models, marking a significant departure from generic datasets.

Harnessing the power of deep learning, I opted for cutting-edge Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, specifically ResNet50 and ConvNeXt. These state-of-the-art models were meticulously designed to surpass the limitations of traditional computer vision approaches and provide a more nuanced and accurate identification of biofouling. The incorporation of these advanced neural networks aimed not only to improve detection accuracy but also to enable the recognition of subtle and intricate biofouling patterns that might elude conventional methods.

To benchmark the performance of these CNN models, I conducted a thorough comparative analysis against traditional machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM) and decision trees. This comprehensive evaluation was essential in understanding the relative strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, providing valuable insights into the transformative potential of deep learning in maritime biosecurity. The findings underscored the superior performance of CNN architectures in biofouling detection, demonstrating their efficacy in enhancing the precision and efficiency of maritime surveillance.

The implications of this research extend beyond technological advancements, signaling a paradigm shift in maritime maintenance and security practices. By leveraging state-of-the-art technologies and bespoke datasets, this initiative not only contributes to the ongoing evolution of biosecurity measures but also paves the way for more accurate, efficient, and proactive approaches to addressing biofouling challenges in the dynamic and complex maritime environment.
