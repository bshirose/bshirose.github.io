My research project on "Multi-Agent Planning" under the guidance of Prof. Matthew from January 2023 to June 2023, is focused on developing a novel and efficient egress maneuver for autonomous agents. The primary objective was to design a maneuver that would ensure an agent's swift evacuation from a designated area, taking no more than 4 seconds to complete. This innovation was crucial in minimizing disruptions to the overall task completion speed and enhancing the user's ease of operation, as it significantly reduced the time agents spent in egress mode.

To test the maneuver's effectiveness, experiments were conducted in environments filled with obstacles, including open spaces as narrow as 0.5 meters. These challenging scenarios aimed to replicate real-world situations where an agile and adaptable egress strategy is vital for multi-agent systems. The results demonstrated the maneuver's success in safely guiding agents through these complex environments. Additionally, the study was extended to encompass various agent types, from RC cars to Boston Dynamics Spot robots, ensuring the maneuver's applicability across a diverse range of autonomous agents. This project not only contributed to the field of multi-agent planning but also underscored the importance of creating agile and adaptable egress strategies for autonomous systems in diverse and dynamic environments.
