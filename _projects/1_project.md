Developing a multi-agent convoy system which involves a coordinated system where multiple agents, such as vehicles or robots, work together to move in a convoy formation. This collaborative effort requires the design and implementation of sophisticated algorithms for communication, coordination, and navigation. Through real-time data exchange and decision-making processes, these agents ensure they maintain proper spacing and alignment while adapting to dynamic environments. Multi-agent convoys have applications in autonomous transportation, military logistics, and swarm robotics, making their development a critical area of research for enhancing efficiency, safety, and adaptability in various domains.
