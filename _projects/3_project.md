In my research project, I meticulously implemented and rigorously tested a repertoire of well-established robust control techniques, which included H-infinity Loop-shaping, H-infinity Optimal Control, H2 Optimal Control, and Mu-synthesis, specifically tailored to the intricate dynamics of the Quanser Bi-copter system. The Quanser Bi-copter is a highly agile and complex aerial vehicle, and the goal was to establish a control system that could ensure stability and reliable performance under conditions of significant coupling between its control inputs and outputs, as well as in the presence of considerable uncertainties in the system's behavior.

Extensive experimentation and analysis were conducted to assess the effectiveness of these control strategies. One of the most remarkable outcomes of this research was the attainment of a robust stability margin of 0.15. This margin showcases the system's impressive ability to maintain stability and consistent performance even in the presence of substantial uncertainty and highly coupled dynamics. These findings have substantial implications, as they demonstrate the feasibility of deploying the Quanser Bi-copter, or similar systems, in demanding real-world scenarios where reliability and stability are paramount, particularly in the face of uncertainties and complex interactions between control inputs and outputs. This research has contributed significantly to the field of robust control theory and its practical applications.
